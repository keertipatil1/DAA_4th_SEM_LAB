# 4th Semester DAA Lab Codes

This repository contains lab codes for the 4th semester in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The programs are organized based on different algorithmic techniques and are used for lab internals.

## Total Number of Programs for Lab Internals 1: 4

### Programs:

1. **Merge Sort**  
   - **Technique:** Divide and Conquer  
   - **Description:** Implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting them, and then merging them back together.

2. **Topological Sorting Using DFS**  
   - **Technique:** Decrease and Conquer  
   - **Description:** Performs topological sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Depth-First Search (DFS).

3. **Presorting and Element Uniqueness**  
   - **Technique:** Transform and Conquer  
   - **Algorithm Used:** Quick Sort  
   - **Description:** Checks for element uniqueness by first sorting the array using Quick Sort and then comparing adjacent elements.

4. **Horspool String Matching**  
   - **Technique:** Time and Space Trade-off  
   - **Description:** Implements the Horspool algorithm for string matching, which uses a heuristic to shift the pattern efficiently and match it against a given text.
