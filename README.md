# 4th Semester DAA Lab Codes

This repository contains lab codes for the 4th semester in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The programs are organized based on different algorithmic techniques and are used for lab internals.

1. **Merge Sort**  
   - **Technique:** Divide and Conquer  
   

2. **Topological Sorting Using DFS**  
   - **Technique:** Decrease and Conquer  
   

3. **Presorting and Element Uniqueness**  
   - **Technique:** Transform and Conquer  
   - **Algorithm Used :** Quick Sort  
   

4. **Horspool String Matching**  
   - **Technique:** Time and Space Trade-off
